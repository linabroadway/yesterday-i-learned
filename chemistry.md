"It is only the dose which makes a thing poison." - Paracelsus

- Water cannot be used to put out gasoline fires because water is heavier; it sinks.
- ["I've been out of that job for almost 20 years, but I think parabens and pthalates acted more as thickeners and stabilizers to help soap have a certain thick 'feel' and stay in solution when sitting a long time"](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/uo5y00/is_bar_soap_a_breeding_ground_for_bacteria/i8e2j8g/) -/u/WiseFerret
- Chelated mineral supplements (e.g. calcium citrate) don't need to be taken with food because ["a mineral has been bound to an acid, so it doesn't rely on your stomach acid to break it down"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/morning-or-night-with-food-or-without-answers-to-your-questions-about-taking-supplements/2019/02/04/5fcec02a-2577-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html). I am not sure why calcium citrate is considered chelated... maybe it really is an alkali earth *metal*, I guess.
- Galvanised (zinc-coated) pipes and fittings can leak zinc into drinking water if the water is, at any point, acidic.
- PEX piping is [resistant to mineral deposits](https://www.rotorooter.com/frequently-asked-questions/pipes/how-to-remove-calcium-buildup-in-drains-and-pipes/)? PVC is not. PEX piping is [colour-coded](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/pex-pipe/): red for hot, blue for cold, and anarchy for any other colour.
- Duralumin is 80% aluminium, 20% copper, and traces of other stuff.
- 1 mÂ³ of gas is roughly 10.5 kWh of energy.
- Aluminium is the only common metal, used as a metal, that is not considered [heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals). Other candidates include: alkali metals, every alkali earth metal except for radium, scandium, and yttrium.
- Aluminium is spelled Aluminum in USA because British chemist [Humphry Davy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy), in all his genius, named sodIUM and potassIUM, and thus named it alumIUM. The Germans complained that *alum* is not latin, so Davy changed it to aluminIUM... only to publish a book with the spelling aluminUM one year after. A [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_%28scientist%29) proposed *aluminium* instead, which ultimately stuck around. Both Davy and Young died 19 years later.
- [Potassium Dichromate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_dichromate) (K2Cr2O7), your favourite inorganic oxidiser, is the 11th most common allergen included in the patch test (chromium is a common allergen). Hexavalent chromium is also a carcinogen.
- [PVC fake leather lasts far longer than PU fake leather](https://bintangkaruniabadi.com/?p=2543) (5+ years vs 1~2 years before flaking off).
- Seasalt is, like, 1 ~ 10% various other salts.
- Hot vinegar *easily* cleans starchy pot stains.
- UV makes biodegradable plastics degrade. So if it ends up in the landfill, it's not going to make a difference.
- Tires used to be all white (adding zinc oxide made them look whiter.) Then in 1910 people started making black tires to avoid damage caused by UV light.
- A chemical called [Aristoflex AVC](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/aristoflex-avc) helps you make your homemade lotion slightly easier to apply by gelling it.
- [Rayon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayon) is a fibre made from cellulose, which is natural, but with synthetic chemical treatment, which makes it synthetic. Rayon can be made to feel like cotton, silk, wool, anything, so don't buy something because it is made of rayon.
- Ice is not harder than steel. It is normally [1.5](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/241907/is-ice-harder-than-steel) on [Mohs scale of hardness.
- Graphene is just a single layer of graphite.
- "[Rose gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_gold#Rose,_red,_and_pink_gold)" is like 22% copper. White gold is commonly 10% nickel. Blue gold has more indium than actual gold, but indium is expensive as well.
- Tidal power plants that leverage the sea typically have a problem with salt water and the maintenance costs that come with it. Actually, salt water *plus* oxygen are the real problem, so even completely submerging the whole thing in the ocean would have been a better idea than extracting power from the tides.
- [Binary chemical weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_chemical_weapon) are chemicals whose active state (before you use it) is less active than after you use it. For example, [methylphosphonyl difluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphosphonyl_difluoride) is relatively safe, but produces sarin if fired. [Novichok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent) are... "relatively safe" when handling as well.
- There are "contaminants from industrial chemicals, bacteria and parasites, fertilizers, and other potentially harmful sources in drinking water", but tap water remains safe to drink because they are limited to "safe" levels.
- Oily rags can spontaneously combust. See also: [linseed oil fires](https://www.esfrs.org/black-museum/all-the-black-museum-cases/spontaneous-combustion-of-linseed-oil/).

- CO2 makes beverages taste more refreshing. It is [one of the most soluble gases that can be commonly found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law#Values_of_Henry's_law_constants). CO2 activates [taste](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654389/#R17) and [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993877/) receptors as well.
- Exxon [knew](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/f2uf3i/the_saddest_thing_is_that_it_wont_be_breaking/fhf7pjk/) as early as [1982](https://thinkprogress.org/exxon-predicted-high-carbon-emissions-954e514b0aa9/) at fossil fuels will lead to environmental problems by 2020, and that the atmospheric CO2 will reach 400 ~ 420ppm by then. They also predicted major economic consequences by 2038, and globally catastrophic effects by 2067.
- [Rubbing alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubbing_alcohol#US_legislation) in the US can contain 10% methanol, acetone, and [methyl isobutyl ketone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_isobutyl_ketone), because fuck chemists, fuck alcoholics, can't just [make it taste bitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denatonium), gotta make it poisonous.
- Nitrogen dioxide is an intermediate for producing nitric acid, but that fact does not help the environment because the factories don't extract NO2 from the air.
- A [**soap**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap) is a salt of a fatty acid, and a [fatty acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid) is an acid---usually [carboxylic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_stearate) or [sulphuric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_laureth_sulfate)---attached to a long hydrophobic chain of hydrocarbons.
- "Sweet" crude oil is oil containing less than 0.7% of sulphur.
- All wines under 15% alcohol will freeze in a freezer (-18 C).
- Glucose is considered an aldehyde (and therefore an aldose). Fructose is a ketone (and therefore a ketose).
- Glass cooktops heat slowly, cool slowly, [crack on heat shock](https://www.hunker.com/13408879/what-causes-ceramic-glass-electric-cook-top-to-crack), crack on contact with heavy things... like a pot, [cannot be cleaned with glass cleaner](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/wrong-way-to-clean-glass-stovetop/)... they are a joke. [Glass is glass, and glass breaks](https://twitter.com/zacksjerryrig/status/1039934465462611968?lang=en). A truly backwards product trend.
- [Diamonds burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqYDGqgKAc8), but only when subjected to high concentrations of oxygen.
- Ozone (for air puritification) is harmful, but not if you turn it on for only a few minutes a day. Hotels use "ozone cannons" to remove odours before a room is rented out.
- Maltodextrin is a type of [dextrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrin), chains of 10 to 20 sugars. Longer chains of that can be called "starch" or "glycogen" depending on how they are chained. Heating starch up makes dextrin.
- Cooling down starchy foods (rice, pasta, potatoes) prdouces [resistant starch](https://www.gisymbol.com/sugars-and-starches/), the kind that is not digested in the small intestine, and is good for the gut and supposedly reduces the risk of bowel cancer.
- An atom in rows 1 to 3 can have at most [8 valence electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron). Once you get to row 4 (where *d* electrons start to appear), the number is raised to 12.
- Lewis structures (middle school) are molecular diagrams with *valence electrons only*. If one side of the bond is more electronegative, then the bond becomes polar covalent. [If one side completely rips an electron from the other, then the bond is ionic.](https://www.quora.com/What-bond-is-stronger-covalent-or-ionic) Ionic bond strength is lower than that of covalent bonds.
- The difference between "polar covalent" and "ionic" is how the bond is established, which is related to electronegativity. Ionic bonds are attraction between two ions and hence pack closely... whereas covalent bonds are bonded by [VSEPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSEPR_theory) rules.
- While electrons can be found anywhere, the s/p/d/f model is still useful for specifying where the elctrons will be, most of the time (electron density).
- While [creatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine) is a useful molecule, [creatinine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine) is metabolic waste, and is sometimes found in creatine supplements. Do not take creatine with NSAIDs. Do not heat creatine beyond 148 degrees C.
- Gasoline has a CO2 multiplier of 3, i.e. [1L or 0.75kg of gasoline produces 2.3kg of CO2](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_6_e.pdf). This is roughly (12+16+16)/(12+2 ish).
- [Diamonds are slippery when wet](https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/06/caution-diamonds-slippery-when-wet/). You can also make carbonated water from diamonds if you burn them hot enough.
- When somebody dies in your house and leaves a stain on your carpet, they take the body away and sprinkle some powder on the human-shaped stain and go away. [This powder](https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1XPFZGDUWXHOH/?) is made with "100% all natural metal oxide mineral consisting essentially of elements comprised of sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, iron, and silicon." You vacuum it up and the stain goes away.
- Use the [tollens reagent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent) (silver nitrate and stuff, high school chem) to detect the presence of an aldehyde group, or any group that tautomerises into an aldehyde. The agent works because silver nitrate loves precipitating out when it sees an aldehyde, including the functional group found in glucose. If you are a "garage chemist", you can use this property to make your own mirrors.
- [There is nothing _bi_ about sodium bicarbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate#Nomenclature). That compound (baking soda, NaHCO3) is just sodium hydrogen carbonate (IUPAC), and the other one (washing soda, Na2CO3) is called sodium carbonate.
- Baking soda removes smell through [simple acid-base reactions](https://steemersandiego.com/2017/07/06/baking-soda-how-does-it-remove-odors/) with the "odour molecules".

- [Ballpoint pen ink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen#Inks) is suspended in some benzyl alcohol or [phenoxyethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenoxyethanol). [Blue inks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_blue) are typically basic, while [black inks](https://sciencing.com/ballpoint-pen-ink-made-of-10036405.html) are mostly [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_black).
- The IUPAC name for NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) is Sodium tetrahydridoborate.
- Depending on who you ask, water can also be called [hydroxylic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_parody).
- Clean stained plastic tupperware with [denture tablets](https://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2015/07/20-things-you-can-clean-with-denture-tablets.html), which are [basically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denture_cleaner#Ingredients) bleach, baking soda, and citric acid.
- ["Carbonated water contains macronutrients that are essential to plant growth, according to researchers at the University of Colorado. The nutrients found in carbonated water are potassium, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and sodium."](https://www.hunker.com/12476437/the-effect-of-carbonated-water-on-plant-growth)
- It is often commercially profitable to recover silver from [sewage sludge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_sludge#Heavy_metals) (20mg/kg or more).
- Assuming the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 kJ/kgK ish, a 500mL cup of hot water (say at 60 degrees) releases about 50 Calories when reduced to 37Â°C. This is not a way to gain weight though, as hot water raises metabolic rate... which actually means you burn more fat.
- The [Hill system/notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula#Hill_system) conventionally controls how molecules are named: first carbons, if any; then hydrogens, if any; then every other element alphabetically. This is a convention, not a law: [ammonia (NH3) is an exception](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-water-written-as-H2O-and-not-OH2), as is HCN, NaCl, and anything ionic.
- [Paraquat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraquat), not related to [kumquat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumquat), is extremely toxic. As "N,Nâ²-dimethyl-4,4â²-bipyridinium dichloride", this oxidising agent interferes with [electron transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transfer), which is common to all life.
- Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) [does not remove stains from clothes](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/can-aspirin-help-remove-stains-and-keep-your-whites-white). Use bleach. Don't waste your money.
- [Some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Origins) gold comes straight from the sun, so it is older than the Earth. The Earth's mantle may also contain gold.
- Contrary to [popular belief], [shade balls in reservoirs do not reduce evaporation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxPdPpi5W4o). These _black_ balls (first hint that it isn't for _reducing_ evaporation) block light from turning aqueous "bromide" (Br-) and "chlorine" (Cl2) into "bromate" (BrO3-), which is carcinogenic. (No... the equations don't balance.) The black balls do absorb more energy than just water, but the balls contain air, which is a heat insulator. Even though these balls are black, they reduce reservoir evaporation by 80%.
- Brass knobs that are shiny are lacquered, making them useless at [disinfection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodynamic_effect).
- Too much COâ in the air makes it "stuffy".
- Did you know that [black plastic is rarely recycled](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_tech_enables_recycling_of_black_plastic/10716818) (think electronics casings) as "normal near infrared (NIR) sensors at recycling plants are unable to detect the black pigment, so black plastics usually go unrecycled worldwide and contribute to climate change."
- If contaminants are present, [(rotten) ice can form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_ice) in the shape of honeycombs.
- "If you are titrating a weak acid with a strong base, for example, the color indicator may change color at a pH that does not necessarily equate to the stoichiometric point." (presumably because you have a buffer solution)
- You can [knock bismuth (in the form of BiCl3 aq) out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qpzFlpgpo) with aluminium foil.
- When it comes to orbitals, the periodic table could be considered incorrect when placing helium over neon. When placed over beryllium, which also has a full s shell, [the periodic table is made of neat blocks that map exactly to s, p, d, and f orbitals](https://cen.acs.org/unassigned/Reactions/97/i3).
- Adding sodium chloride to hard water [should](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_softening) soften it. Adding [limewater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_%28material%29) (mixture of CaCO3, CaO, and Ca(OH)â) through [Clark's process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_softening), somehow also softens water by changing pH, making the existing calcium carbonate in the water precipitate out.
- [Mass spectrometry can be used to extract molecules from fingerprints, not just the shape, to determine what the person ate and drank and sweated and touched.](https://go.ted.com/CtsK)
- Glycerin, [glycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol), and propane-1,2,3-triol are all the same thing. [Glycerides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceride) are however esters formed from glycerol and fatty acids, i.e. `H3C-(O-R)3`, assuming all functional groups are the same `R`.
- Drywall isn't just anything white; drywall is gypsum (calcium sulphate).
- Hot water can carry much less COâ, so global warming _caused by COâ levels_ is a scary positive feedback loop.
- [Activated carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon) is charcoal with lots of holes.
- Lead (element 82) is the heaviest element considered ["stable"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability), but Bismuth-209 (element 83) is not that radioactive either.
- Helium is called Helium because it was discovered while looking at the sun (absorption spectra).
- Because of the wintergreen oil inside, lifesavers glow (triboluminescence) when crushed.
- One gram of poppy seeds contains up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine.
- Salt doesn't cure meat. Curing salt contains maybe 7% sodium nitrite and an optional amount of sodium nitrate.
- Tungsten is from Swedish _tung sten_, "heavy stone".
- [Billard balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_ball) are made with some sort of phenolic resin, basically any "plastic materials that are strongly resistant to cracking and chipping".
- A [hydrometer](https://learn.kegerator.com/using-a-hydrometer/) (_hydromÃ¨tre_) measures a liquid's density relative to water. A hydrometer does not measure water.
- A [hermetic seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_seal) is an airtight seal.
- Cubic zirconia is 1.7 times heavier than diamond.
- [Selenium disulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_disulfide) as a dandruff treatment works only if you keep using it. Dandruff comes back if you stop.
- [Do **not** hit someone in the head with a glass bottle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9cc7cy/what_are_some_cliche_things_that_people_do_in/e59q50x/) [Glass bottles in movies are made of sugar or plastic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9cc7cy/what_are_some_cliche_things_that_people_do_in/e59uzs0/) and will break much more easily than actual glass bottles. People can die if you fracture their skull.
- A 85:15 ethene/oxygen mixture [was](https://medium.com/@pharmakeus/more-on-ethylene-anesthetic-gases-part-i-613324aa477c) sometimes used as a general anesthetic.
- DEET is N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide or diethyltoluamide, none of which have letters that spell DEET sequentially.
- [Vaseline stood for "wasser" (water) + "-line" (oil)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_jelly), and it is not a trademark name in Europe.
- Not only does hydrogen leak out of metal containers, it weakens the containers by making them [brittle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_embrittlement).
- Diphenylhydramine is a local anesthetic, and numbs the mouth when taken orally.
- Rohypnol does not have a single hydroxyl group on it.
- Titanium is biocompatible, and is used extensively in implants. With that said, a titanium knee joint only lasts 10-15 years.
- Newly-sheared wool contains a lot of [lanolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanolin), a grease which is apparently valuable in making beauty products. Other [colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool#/media/File:CSIRO_ScienceImage_11160_Siroscour.jpg) are mostly caused by dead skin.

- TNT production brings about toxic [pink water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_water), which, although colourless, will become dark brown if under the sun for long enough.
- [Mineral oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_oil) (clear colourless mixtures of alkanes) are carcinogenic (group 1 if untreated, group 3 if treated). Baby oil happens to be made with mineral oil, so either baby oil is treated to the point to being medical grade, or maybe babies don't care about cancer risk that much.
- Hydrazine, HâN-NHâ, is explosive. You can [make it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine#Synthesis_and_production) by mixing ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (conditions unknown, so don't do it). Butanone is somehow part of the reaction.
- [SN1 reactions are racemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racemic_mixture) because [the carbon first forms a planar molecule](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/nucleophilic-substitution-sn1-sn2.shtm), allowing the nucleophile to attack from either side.
- [Histamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine) has a vasodilating effect, allowing white blood cells to slip through capillaries. A side effect of body-wide vasodilation (if injected intravenously or enough is taken) is a drop in blood pressure.

- [Sterling silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_silver) is 92.5% silver, not because people are cheap, but because pure silver is too soft to be anything. There is no regulation what the 7.5% needs to be, but it is usually copper.
- [Brassica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica) (broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts) is said (not cited) to taste bad because a) sulphur if overcooked, or b) [phenylthiocarbamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylthiocarbamide).
- [Enteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_coating) can be made of any kind of polymer they find fit. See wiki for a list. They protect the stomach from drugs that activate in acidic environments, or (if you look at it the other way) protect the drug from being wasted in the stomach before it reaches the intestines.
- Alka-Seltzer is aspirin, baking soda, and citric acid (for making the baking soda bubble). "In the early 1960s a commercial showing two tablets dropping into a glass of water instead of the usual one caused sales to double."
- Mixing ammonia and bleach doesn't give you chlorine; mixing the two gives you [chloramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramine), NHâCl (makes sense right). "Chloramine is used as a disinfectant for water because it is less aggressive than chlorine and more stable against light than hypochlorites."
- You can buy silver nitrate from Amazon.
- [Picric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picric_acid) is actually a phenol. Drying it out makes it explode.
- Summer gas and winter gas have different vapour pressures. [There is a marginal difference in mileage.](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-consumption/summer-fuel1.htm) It is however claimed that the air is cleaner with special blends than if either one were used.
- [Some molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopulariopsis) can turn [paints with Scheele's Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheele%27s_Green) into arsine gas (AsH3), which is then cancerous.
- [Dead alkaline batteries bounce higher.](http://theconversation.com/it-turns-out-theres-truth-to-dead-battery-bounce-after-all-38680) Specifically, alkaline batteries that have zinc(s) suspended in a gel will slowly convert this zinc(s) into ZnO(s), which is a harder material that causes the battery to bounce higher.
- Cobalt was discovered before oxygen. It took them something like 70 years to discover sodium after cobalt.

Battery life still depends on the actual hours since made, so just because 1/0.26 = 3.84, it doesn't mean you get a battery that lasts 3.8x longer (more like 2). The equation appears to follow `y = 0.0027 * e^{5.8x}`.

- [The mint lifesaver glows in the dark when bitten into.](http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question505.htm) "Actually, all hard sugar-based candies emit some degree of light when you bite them, but most of the time, that light is very faint." Crystalline sugar emits energy as UV light when crushed, and the methyl salicylate in that mint absorbs UV light and emits visible light.
- [TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene) is not [trinitroglycerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin), which can be made by slowly adding 1:1 HNO3/H2SO4 into cold glycerol. The HNO3/H2SO4 process is done twice for TNT, plus an extra nitration step using HNO3 and oleum (apparently).
