## You aren't alone, no...

> When people tell you to "open up your emotions", it means "be open about your feelings as long as you don't actually have any problems".

You and you alone are responsible for your physical, mental, and social wellbeing.
- When booking an AirBnB, [look for cameras literally everywhere](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/08/airbnb_host_jailed/). They can be hidden in cushions, lamps, as one of the lights in the router, behind mirrors...
- When someone asks "Where are you from" or "What do you do", try to respond the question with something that relates to the asker.

If you are the one answering "What do you do", then attempt to add the word "help" into the response, i.e. ["I help people get the best Japanese candies the country has to offer,"](https://www.candyjapan.com/) rather than "I run a website that sells Japanese candies". A valid alternative to "What do you do" is "How do you spend most of your time".

They will feel as if their interests are affirmed and that they've helped improve the social setting around them."

- _Parroting_ is a lazy technique that repeats a term from the last sentence the other person said. followed by a question mark. It is a bailout method that keeps the conversation going without contributing anything to it. "I watched Westworld last night. It was amazing." "Westworld?"
- You are [supposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/9lx87k/lpt_be_respectful_of_haunted_house_actors_theyre/) to act scared in a haunted house out of courtesy.

You cannot explain in a "condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner" if you think the woman already knows everything---including what you don't---and is asking merely to test your knowledge, and to assert her authority.
- Whenever you feel you should keep quiet to avoid confrontation, remember this was what the Republic of China said to its troops when Japan started its invasion: "須萬分容忍，不與抵抗，以免事態擴大" (need to tolerate everything they do, do not resist, lest we make the situation worse).
- Always begin a conversation with ["Can we talk?"](https://www.reddit.com/comments/4jymdh).

- [Find yourself a big goal](https://raddevon.com/articles/8-things-i-learned-to-get-from-walmart-cashier-to-6-figure-web-developer/), one that you will need years to achieve. This is a good way to develop skills, and turn skills into money.

- When [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/space_spiders_live.html) brought spiders to space, they struggled for a bit (because none of their ancestors have been in space), made webs that looked like they were drugged or something, but eventually adapted to microgravity and made proper webs.

[Don't do anything stupid like fighting or killing him](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h9wv4x/update_you_were_right_i_ignored_every_single_one/), because [cheating on you is perfectly legal](https://familyllb.com/learn/adultery-and-affairs-understanding-the-basis-for-divorce-in-ontario/) (not even a crime! doesn't affect custody and spousal support!) but killing a man is not.
- Women don't actually want to argue; arguing is not their thing. Winning *is* their thing. They win by arguing, or by refusing to argue. As long as they win, they don't care.
- A partner who says ["I am the good-looking one"](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gzr9c5/i_31m_told_my_girlfriend_30f_that_she_is_not_a/fthtt4k/) is saying you are the bad-looking one.

This is why the fewer flaws you have, the better your relationships will be.

But I don't want it to "not matter". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life.

## Know what you want / to do at work

> "Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm being paid for here is my loyalty. But if there were somewhere else that valued loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most." - Dwight Schrute

- "If you work 12-hour days and spend no time at all eating, you can work an internship on top of your full time job" - paraphrasing [this woman over here](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-lessons-ive-learned-from-taking-an-internship-on-top-of-my-fulltime-job)
- "Unlimited PTO at manager's discretion" is just having no PTO.
- [Testing in prod is ok](https://increment.com/testing/i-test-in-production/), as long as you know what you're doing, and are prepared to take responsibility when things go south.
- If you become a manager and find that you actually suck quite much at it (and don't want to fake it til you make it), [you can switch back to doing whatever you were doing](https://medium.com/s/please-advise/should-i-become-a-manager-bfebe857a457). No one said no backsies.
- "You're not paid based on the value of your labor: You're paid based on the cost to replace you." - Some guy, who seemed to know his stuff
- You know you dun goof'd when QA asks "What level of testing was done prior to submitting this patch" in your change, or like, "On the next patch, can you please add more unit tests (...)", because clearly you haven't tested anything.
- If you are ever asked to provide a reference from your manager, [just don't](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28692753), whether your relationship with them is good or bad. Nothing good comes out of it. If you ask your manager for reference, they will know you are looking for a job. If you tell your new company you are unable to provide the reference because you have a bad relationship with your current manager, then obviously you won't get the job. Decline such requests and forget you ever interviewed with them.
- There are many reasons people [burn out and quit](https://mayakaczorowski.com/blogs/burnout): work not being recognised, no promotions, everyone else left, having the same conversations over and over and not making any progress... the list goes on.
- In bad company, [stick to your job](https://old.reddit.com/r/softwaretesting/comments/pnvtc4/do_you_find_yourself_doing_more_than_just_testing/hcsjtps/), because /u/zer0_snot has interesting insights: "Do anything extra (even once). And that extra thing will become a norm and always be expected of you in the future", "Competent work completion is always rewarded with more responsibilities irrespective of your bandwidth", "Work completed quickly is almost always seen as a bad thing", and "Good work will rarely be appreciated".

- ["Intelligence increases through your mistakes, through ups and downs, or what you've learned."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1p2PbfNk0c) - Rob, that guy who says to stop saying "I can't", but "How can I?"
- High-level bosses want results. Low-level bosses want solutions. Neither of them want excuses. They don't need to hear about your failed attempts. They need to know the successes that they can report upwards. A bit like top-down communism.
- "Don't strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt." - Grace Liechtenstein
- A [Chesterton's Fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence) is a rule that should not be removed without understanding why it was put there. It goes on to say that [you should document the reasoning behind a rule](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24208390) so others know why that rule exists.
- "Poaching" implies your employee is going to work for your competitor against their free will. [Offering them a higher salary than you do certainly doesn't fit the definition of "poaching"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24122265), yet here we are.
- It says ["know your worth"](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/know-your-worth-then-live-like-you-know-it/), not "know that you are worth a lot". You can be worthless and not know it.
- When you're down because you feel like you can't do something, remember you can't do everything, like growing proper facial hair (if you're Asian).
- ["Never ask a question to show that you already know something, but always ask in earnest and be vulnerable to the fact that you don't know something."](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23661383) - Milton Glaser, guy who designed "I ♥ NY"

- You're still getting emailed by recruiters because [although plenty of developers greduate from university, the need for them also increased](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/go21fz/and_so_it_begins_shopify_permanently_moves_to/frdtiv2/). Globalisation messes with all that because plenty of developers don't want to relocate.
- A principal developer [mentors those below them](https://sizovs.net/2019/02/15/the-principal-developer/), while not being the best of the best. They're a role model others want to follow. They should also be able to influence how other departments function, so [they need to know the business side as well](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-senior-developer-and-a-lead-developer). This is another way of saying "coders don't know coding isn't everything".
- Someone can plant incriminating evidence in your office even if there is nothing inside to steal.
- ["If you're a developer, become friends with the sales team at your work. Seeing things through a less technical lens will make you much more effective." ...

- Without looking at cause and effect, [there are far more shady people working blue collar jobs than white collar jobs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22042701). White collar jobs are "cushy" for a reason.
- You are worse than you think: ["Half of my income is from training people in JS and Python. I have 50% of those missions that are requested to be "advanced" courses. The vast majority of the participants are not up to the task. They are paid professionals, but they consistently overestimate they level, skills and needs. They often are not very good, and of course, they don't know what they don't know."](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21832825)
- When you start a new job, instead of asking for help all the time, look for README files. (You should do this naturally anyway, given the lack options available to you.) Also [don't run scripts just because people tell you to](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/).
- "To lead people, walk behind them." - Lao Tzu
- Personal projects don't matter [beyond the entry-level job market](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8k8yad/do_personal_projects_matter_beyond_the_entrylevel/), but you still need to know your shit, including stuff you don't do at work, which is why you need personal projects anyway.
- [Being good at a lot of similar things](https://forge.medium.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-something-f1b658f93428) is sufficient, and far less demanding, than being the best at one thing.
- Sometimes it might be good to think about [doing something with a high ROTI (return on time invested)](https://www.inc.com/john-eades/why-you-should-be-more-worried-about-your-return-on-time-instead-on-investment.html) rather than just ROI, i.e. "is it worth my time?" "Beyond a good income, what do you want to achieve from your career? Professional accolades? Awards? The knowledge you've made a difference? All are valuable. All require time. None can be purchased with cash."
- Resumes full of one-to-two-year experiences can also mean the companies you choose are [hire-and-fire places](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21322696) that kill you off when a project is complete.
- Developers, get a plan B. Software development as a lifelong career is statistically absurd. If you aren't the top 1%, chances are you won't remain a 65-year old software wizard (i.e. architect). If you aren't going to be a wizard, then perhaps think if you can be a manager. But only 10% can be a manager. So what are the other 89% going to do? **You need a plan B**. Be a plumber, realtor, [home inspector](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/dlyup2/good_paying_jobs_with_minimal_post_secondary/), casino dealer, bus driver, air traffic controller, water treatment, CP rail, welding, or something.
- If you do your day job properly, and you happen to be good at doing screener tests, you don't really need personal projects to back up your skills. Since personal projects are personal, you rarely reach the required depth of knowledge that people expect, anyway.
- I was told you can prank your colleagues, but you can't prank your boss.

- "It is the working man who is the happy man. It is the idle man who is the miserable man." -

- "I am easily distracted" is an okay weakness to mention during an interview.
- Being a leader largely involves [gaining respect](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/tips-for-success-as-a-team-leader-1919252), which usually means doing the dirty work, making tough decisions, and having a backbone.
- "Move to management. Fluff the resume a bit and put yourself out there as someone who can manage a decent term project and get stuff done. Job interviews, much like everything in life, comes down to 10% what you say, and 90% how you say it. Come across as wise not old, confident not down on yourself, and have an air of "If you don't hire me you're a f'in moron" without actually saying that, and you might be surprised what you get."
- Any personal project is a good personal project if [it has a gif demo in the readme](https://thehftguy.com/2016/10/24/heres-how-to-make-a-good-github-project-for-your-resume/). Apart from you and your own self esteem, no one cares about your code.

## Welcome criticism

> "I'm at that stage in life where I stay out of discussions. Even if you say 1+1=5, you're right - have fun." - Keanu Reeves

- Not all criticism is good. Hell, not even all suggestions are good. Think *critically* about criticism before acting on it.
- [Blind men and an elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)... many perspectives can be correct at the same time. Don't disagree so readily.
- "Snitches get stitches" - My partner
- **Body language matters when giving advice.** Be natural, look open, don't look distracted. Put yourself to the side and listen as if you are them. Don't interrupt, even if you have heard it already. Just point out the patterns. (NPR life kit)
- [Don't be afraid to be wrong](https://ketanbhatt.com/2018/08/12/dont-be-the-alpha-geek-your-team-deserves-better/), accept new opinions, stop being defensive, because you aren't always right, and not forever.
- You can't argue with someone who's shorter-tempered than you, and continue to make that claim. In fact, you can't really argue with someone who's short-tempered and win. The only way to win is not to argue.
- Don't argue to be "right" because [you can be right and miss the entire point](http://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/04/your-statement-is-100-correct-but.html?m=1), making your entire argument useless. Being on point is a skill you must practice.
- Don't argue with someone who entered the argument with the mindset that their opinion is obviously right, or that your opinion is stupid. Anyone like that will not be listening to you. They are not worth your time.
- [Welcome criticism.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3ocfXMjBajIvUKiSQDMbog) If you don't take criticism well, you can't improve at a rate above average. If a Chinese website laughs at Hong Kong people for speaking broken Mandarin, you welcome the criticism. You practice the **fuck** out of your Mandarin. 香港人，記住唔好衰俾人睇。You improve beyond their imagination, exceeding their proficiency in their own native (and sometimes, only) tongue. And then you _don't_ laugh at their broken English, because doing so will give them the idea to improve it.
- [Arguing doesn't work. People just believe in whatever they believed in.](https://lifelessons.co/personal-development/howtogetsmarterpart5/) See also: lots of tips and tricks for arguing and learning in general.
- Learn to take responsibility. For yourself, for your mistakes, and for others. "The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha." - Copilot wanted me to credit The Art of War for some reason, but it's from a subreddit.
- "I constantly get out of my comfort zone. (Staying in the comfort zone) is the easiest way to mediocrity." - Terry Crews (actual part of the quote was "Looking cool")

- Positivity blog [says](https://www.independentlyhappy.com/pollyanna-defined/): people find being overly positive annoying, but being overly positive is a good thing. Be overly positive!
- If one day you become even half as rich as Jeff Bezos, [be like Mackenzie Scott](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-mackenzie-scott-donations/), not like Jeff.

Apparently it was cool for a woman to sport a moustache back then.
- Always apply to scholarships. It's free to apply. It takes an hour to apply. You don't get paid $2000/hr very often.
- Think of "you're adorable" as whether you can be adored, the same way people say "a face only a mother could love".
- [Life never gets easier](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5rjz43/when_does_life_get_easier/) (with the exception of your first month, where you struggled to even breathe). You just get stronger, and [make the best of it by making your life satisfying](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5rjz43/when_does_life_get_easier/dd7xssj/).

- "The "stuff" thing really resonated with me. I value not having a lot of stuff. I prefer less clutter, fewer things to maintain or care about. I hate that our society is often centered around the acquisition of material things, most of which have no practical use, and even dubious aesthetic use. I'm certainly not completely spartan, and do have stuff, but I try to be careful about what I let into my home ..." - [kelnos](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kelnos)
- Reciprocity (or "being thankful") is the core antidote to feeling dissatisfied. [Life less than the most satisfying is also a good life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0): "Life can feel amazing [after serious hardship like chemotherapy] is over. The smallest things can be bottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste, to just sitting in the Sun or chatting with a friend." [Sources](https://sites.google.com/view/sources-dissatisfaction/). Want to start? Once or twice a week, keep a [gratitude journal](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_journal?_ga=2.95683418.716560968.1562229048-1958402826.1562229048) writing down what you felt thankful for.
- "We did not come here to fear the future." - Thanks Obama
- There isn't a purpose in life. Your purpose in life is what you make it, [and that will keep you busy until it is time for you to exit the stage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/c7oj0c/how_do_you_not_question_the_point_of_life_all_the/)
- Happiness comes from inside. You make your own happiness. No one owes you anything. That means **you need to do something to make yourself happy**. "Happiness is what happens when what you think, what you say, and what you do are the same thing."
- "Never grow up, just learn to be an adult." - [Frazer271009's Dad](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bq7pbb/what_is_something_someone_said_to_you_that_hit/eo1v1m6/)
- "When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up." - C. S. Lewis
- "Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." - not necessarily Marcus Aurelius, but attributed to him anyway
- [Not all carpenters are created equal.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BcN7q9V7hSI) Do realise that if someone did a sloppy job, you _don't_ have to pay them.
- Start a meaningful conversation with strongly opinionated topics and open-ended questions, like music and movies.
- **Rich** mindset ... help others and cultivate relationships with no expectation of anything in return. **Poor** mindset thinks "I scratch your back, you scratch mine". **Rich** mindset understands that there is no "I made it". No "done". Life is defined by challenges and learning. **Poor** mindset believes that one day they'll be able to "retire" – to kick back and do nothing. That all work is simply "paying dues" on the way to a life of leisure. Ironically this is the kind of mindset that stifles the ambition and drive required to ever get to the point of having that kind of life as an option. - [Other analogies](https://thomasjfrank.com/the-rich-mindset-vs-the-poor-mindset/)
- "Remember that you asked for growth. Don't be surprised when life decides to challenge the fuck out of you." (many variations of this quote exist)

## Take care of yourself

> "I feel that manning up is what men do, (that) we think we should just take it on the chin. But it's actually the opposite - that's not a brave thing, to suffer in silence. [The really courageous thing to do is to face your problems, face the pain that you're suffering.](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48940521) Trying to fix it, that's what's really courageous."

- [Consume less, create more](https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-more). Don't just scroll Reddit all day long. Go and write something, paint something, draw, and code. Don't convince yourself that reading is self-improvement; if you read and don't do, it's like you have never read at all.

- When you go on a vacation, [turn off your water and water heater, but not the heat](https://old.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/o9qbc1/going_away_for_vacation_for_a_week_and_a_half/). Turn it back on **slowly** when you return. Turn off your gas and ice maker too, while you are at it.

["Fuck you,"](https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/americans-still-see-men-as-the-providers-in-a-relationship.html/) says society.

- A ["tincture of benzoin"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tincture_of_benzoin), a mixture of ethanol and [benzoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoin_%28resin%29) --- which is a resin from [benzoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoic_acid) --- helps bandages stay on for longer. Benzoic acid (>5mg/kg) seems to be safer than nicotine (1mg/kg).
- Slippers guard your toes against other hard objects.
- According to an unsourced meme, [being in a one-bedroom apartment for the rest of your life until you're placed in a nursing home by the government](https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/dr6znb/pretty_much_this/) was once a form of punishment.
- Wear gloves when you use oven cleaner sprays, which strips fats away from anything.

- "Plan your next 30 years" - 80000 hours. ["Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." - Mike Tyson](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13414116).
- Before you buy a house... make sure it isn't over a known flight path. And make sure there isn't a party venue next to it.
- Make sure a "smoke-free" clause applies to all apartment tenants in your building. Some of these tenants may be grandfathered from a contract that omits that clause. If not, smoke can travel into your apartment from someone else's.
- Washing your face easily yields higher returns than the cost of whatever \$10 face wash you use every day.
- You can calculate how much you need to invest into your retirement by reverse calculating from how much you want every month (no taxes for simplicity). Say you want $10k in passive income every month in whichever currency. A year of that is $120k, and if you say you get that much from a 5% capital growth per year, then your actual investment is 120k / 5% = 2.4M. So you will have to figure out how to get this 2.4M in 20 years. 2.4M in 20 years is (interestingly enough) back to 120k per year. So unless you save 10k every month now, you aren't retiring.
- Lining your boots with tinfoil might help with the winter times.
- It is possible to take your CPP out early (at 60) [if you don't plan to live for long.](https://retirehappy.ca/four-reasons-why-you-should-still-take-cpp-early-post-2011-rules/) The breakeven time depends on how many years it'll take to lose however much you got in the five years (60~65) under that percentage penalty.
- The difference between a good day and a bad day is how much alcohol you want to consume, versus how much you need to consume. ~Rob
- Don't eat out. But ["When you do eat out, make it count"](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/6p1zw1/spartan_living_will_make_your_life_easier/)
- Timeshares are complex: each owner wants to make their own decisions. [You don't want that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnltGCBLo4Q&feature=youtu.be). You also don't want to going to the same place every year for the rest of your life. Timeshares are also properties that don't generate income... and hard to sell.
- Some 0%-interest deals [stop your autopay like a month before the payments end, because they really, really want to earn your money](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/g9p1em/beware_the_0_promotions_a_warning/).
- The No Tech Magazine [once](https://www.notechmagazine.com/2019/01/the-complication-of-leisure.html) suggested that the tools used for hobbies ("boating, bicycling, skiing or backpacking") are being improved by manufacturer, so much so that we forget what we actually want out of the hobby. Doing traditional archery, for example, ["promotes a sense of fun and encourages a carefree spirit."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/720481.The_Traditional_Bowyer_s_Bible_Volume_1)

- When returning something to the retailer/owner via UPS, remember to get a receipt. They might fake not receiving it and charge you extra for "losing" the item.
- ["The nice thing about IKEA is that you pretty much get what you pay for."](https://www.quora.com/How-easily-does-IKEA-furniture-fall-apart)
- Realtors don't do the lawyer stuff; lawyers do the lawyer stuff. You can (if you want) buy and sell houses without a realtor. "The real work in a real estate transaction is done by the lawyers... title searches, transfer of funds, lien registrations, signing of documents, and more... Real estate agents show the house, and very little more. They write the offer, but anyone can do that, the forms are pre-printed."
- If a piece of hardware *requires* the internet to work, you don't own that hardware.
- To train vocals, sing through your closed lips for a few minutes.
- For appointments that have late cancellation fees, check if you can bump the appointment up for free. If it is free to do so, then bump the appointment up enough that the late cancellation time no longer applies.
- Version 1 of some scams go as far as "One day a guy rang me up saying I got a parcel but needed to verify my name". Version 2 involve the scammer looking up your phone number _and then_ your name online, so they can sound more legitimate. This is why **you should not put your phone number and your name in the same document**.

## We only live once

> "A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once. It seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come." - William Shakespeare

- "If you stress too much about something before it happens, you basically put yourself through it twice." - Online quotes
- Radon-induced lung cancer is one of the reasons you can die, even if you have done everything right. When death wants to get you, it gets you. Live your life, kids.
- [/u/CaptainNoBoat on climate change](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/oimpq5/earths_atmosphere_is_retaining_heat_twice_as_fast/h4wybgg/): "... [there is a delay in air temperature increase](https://skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html). This means that the carbon already emitted will take 40 years to reach its full potential. This is largely due to the slow process of Earth's oceans warming. In many ways, **we're only feeling the full effects of emissions from the 80's right now.** ... If we did the impossible and switched entirely to 100%, zero-emission, fictional renewables today and provided zero carbon footprint... We'd *still be in dire conditions for generations to come*."
- "Caskets and coffins are a surprisingly good deal at Costco." - [businessinsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-what-to-buy-best-deals-2019-4#buy-caskets-46)
- "Take care of yo' body" - [paraphrasing Robin Hobb](http://www.robinhobb.com/blog/posts/38429), who put it together rather nicely
- Don't go around getting [medical tests](https://www.23andme.com) for something if the results from the test won't change what you do and how you treat it.
- [Do not "life hack" your surgical masks](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/gj5cux/-/fqjad44). People have been using surgical masks for decades. "Never do you see a doctor or a nurse trying to 'hack' a mask, you just put it on and it does its job, otherwise, it would be designed differently."
- When at a funeral, don't say "they're at a better place now", "you'll meet again", and "they're always with you". Actually there's no need to say anything at all. **Give them a hug** or feed them or help them get gas if they're too lost to live. They just want that person back. Save them for another day.
- Half the fun of skydiving comes from knowing your parachutes might fail and you might die. Yet you do not.
- Do not donate your (dead) body for research, even if it means [no cost for burial](https://www.crossroadshospice.com/hospice-palliative-care-blog/2017/october/18/body-donation-after-death-what-you-need-to-know/). [Your body can be sold to someone else](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7303455/Man-donated-moms-body-dementia-research-learns-strapped-chair-blown-up.html), and your estate won't even be paid. [Your body could be sewn together with someone else's](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dismembered-body-parts-sewn-together-frankenstein-donation-center-fbi-found-n1035131). As long as you exist, no one can guarantee you the respect you deserve.
- Doctors merely delay the inevitable.
- "None of us are getting out of here alive, so please stop treating yourself like an after thought. Eat the delicious food. Walk in the sunshine. Jump in the ocean. Say the truth that you're (carrying) in your heart like hidden treasure. Be silly. Be Kind. Be weird. There is no time for anything else." - [/u/hotsauceinmyeye's mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/6aq640/image_we_buried_mum_today_we_found_this_in_one_of/)
- Wherever you go, no matter how impoverished, there are locals living there, not because they love the place (which is possible), but because they cannot leave / sustain an income elsewhere. Who doesn't want to live in Havana, in Lisbon, New York, Santiago? Loving a place is overrated---especially if there is no one there to love you back. If you have upward mobility, *do* move to a better place.
- "For the rest of the earth’s organisms, existence is relatively uncomplicated. Their lives are about three things: survival, reproduction, death—and nothing else. But we know too much to content ourselves with surviving, reproducing, dying—and nothing else. We know we are alive and know we will die. We also know we will suffer during our lives before suffering—slowly or quickly—as we draw near to death. This is the knowledge we “enjoy” as the most intelligent organisms to gush from the womb of nature. And being so, we feel shortchanged if there is nothing else for us than to survive, reproduce, and die. We want there to be more to it than that, or to think there is. This is the tragedy: Consciousness has forced us into the paradoxical position of striving to be unself-conscious of what we are—hunks of spoiling flesh on disintegrating bones." – Thomas Ligotti
