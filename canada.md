Best Buy says a restocking fee applies, but hey... [CRTC says Bell doesn't charge it](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/lt150507b.htm).
- [Old age security requires you to have been in Canada for 10 years or more.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/plan-finances/senior-benefits.html) Guranteed Income Supplement (GIS) requires you to be receiving OAS in the first place.

- A funeral can be [upsold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRNaqntsLPI) to *tens of thousands* per person. No law requires a body to be embalmed, and a casket is like $200, not $7000. The bottom line: do not go to a funeral home owned by Arbor.
- [Winnipeg has the highest parking fines in the country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB24lj71VPA). Legal traps. Signs that say you can park there, but you practically can't because of a fire hydrant or a "crosswalk" or something. **Cash grab**. Private parking tickets are bullshit and not legally enforceable.

- National Building Code require condos to have a minimum sound [transmission class (STC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_transmission_class) of [52](https://ccitoronto.org/condovoice/31), while the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) require an FSTC of 55. An STC of 50 is "Loud sounds faintly heard", while 60 or higher is good soundproofing, where sounds generally do not disturb neighbours. Impact noise like chairs moving are not regulated by the NBC.

- Housing bubbles pop if [people cannot afford housing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/housing_bubble.asp), which can be caused by an economic downturn, a rise of interest rates resulting from an economic boom, or if no one wants houses anymore. If [the first is directly linked to the second](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/eilc1j/canada_back_in_worlds_top_10_economies_with_room/fcs2291/), i.e. the economy is driven by low interest rates, there is no way out for this bubble.

- Once issued, the [Victoria Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross_%28Canada%29) cannot be revoked.

[You can open an RESP for yourself...](https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/invest/savings-plans/resps/how-resps-work/) and if you do so (and you go to school), while your contributions are not tax-deductible, the _earnings_ are tax-free. To maximise the ratio of government contribution to your kid's education, contribute (500/0.2)/12 = $208 per month. You end up with $54000, which is probably enough for the average tuition fee _even if you don't make a return on your investments_.

The money comes directly from the federal government.
- View your newspaper biases from [2019 Canadian federal election party endorsements by media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_federal_election#Endorsements). Toronto Star is liberal. National Post is conservative. No one liked NDP. Le Devoir supported BQ.
- The [Hudson's Bay point blanket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_point_blanket) was traded to First Nations in exchange for beaver pelts.

The Bay even had [its own flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Hudson%27s_Bay_Company) when it was a _de facto_ government. [Their motto](http://www.hbcheritage.ca/faq), _pro pelle cutem_, "skin for leather", was apparently a play on [Job, 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+2%3A4&version=NIV): _Pellem pro pelle_, "skin for skin".
- Elections have federal and provincial [expense limits](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=loi/com/arc/com2017&document=p6&lang=e), some bracketed, some are not; some have limits, some do not.

- [89% of Canada's land is crown land; the other 11% is privately owned.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_ownership_in_Canada) When you "buy" a place or land with that place, you only buy "land tenure" (right to hold the land) in that place.

- [Pension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension) is funded by your employer. [Canada Pension Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Pension_Plan) (CPP) is funded by you... but [you only need to make one contribution to CPP to collect every single pension after that](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-benefit/eligibility.html). So work at least once before you turn 65.
- If no one can have sex in public, and homeless people don't have homes, then it is already illegal for the poor to reproduce (if everyone were perfectly lawful, anyway).

This "nation" is not a country but a collection of people, like in "first nations". In Chinese, this translates to either [民族 (ethnic/ethnographic group), 國族 (actually "nation"), 族群 (ethnic group), or 人種 (race)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F_%28%E6%B6%88%E6%AD%A7%E7%BE%A9%29).

- ["CTV"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network), owned by Bell, has never meant "Canadian television" because [CBC claims to have exclusive rights to the term "Canadian"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network#Early_years).
- ["300,000 Canadians ... call Hong Kong home."](https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2019/08/19/why-are-there-so-many-canadians-in-hong-kong.html) "Most Canadians living in Hong Kong were born in Hong Kong and only lived in Canada for four to five years, according to the foundation's report."

- [Canadians cannot do a "credit freeze"](https://globalnews.ca/news/5706918/capital-one-breach-new-social-insurance-number-sin/). The concept is American-only. Replacing your SIN does not erase your old one, and any debt incurred by the old one is still going to be paid by you, so getting a new SIN is not useful for fraud protection, and is [not entertained by the government](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/sin/protect.html) unless the SIN has _already_ been used for fraud.
- [Canola oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola_oil#Origin) came from CAN- (Canada) and -OLA (suffix for other oil products). It is a variant of rapeseed oil, so not all rapeseed oil is canola oil, but all canola oil is rapeseed oil.

- On [women poking holes in condoms](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13511/index.do) to get themselves pregnant, the supreme court says: it is sexual assault (since it invalidates the partner's consent) but not fraud (since unwanted fatherhood is not serious bodily harm to the man). On [_men_ poking holes in their own condoms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/man-s-refusal-to-wear-condom-after-agreeing-to-cancels-out-consent-judge-1.4492602): it is fraud and sexual assault at the same time.

- [King George V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V) said that [the Canada flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Canada)'s red and white colours were to come from [Saint George's Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Cross), and the French royal emblem, respectively. However, the red on the Saint George's Cross is rgb(207, 8, 31); the red on the [Union Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack), which _has_ the Saint George's Cross in it, is rgb(200, 16, 46); both of which are different from Canada's rgb(255, 0, 0), so Canada didn't actually get the red from Saint George's Cross. There was actually no record of [Saint George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George), a dude born in [present-day Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia), personally using his cross, but the people of [Genoa, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa) made that flag and attributed the design to him, so... it's his flag now.
- If you make about [300 kCAD/year](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/03/14/top-one-per-cent-canada_a_23385825/), you are the top 1%. (Stats Canada says it's 400k, while HuffPost says it's 300k. Either way, since you work for free, you aren't the top 1%.)

- Landshark Lager is made by the brick brewery.
- The Waterloo region [can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Ontario#Climate) reach "feels like 50 degrees" during the summer.
- When the region of Waterloo says [we'll help pay 5% of your house](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterloo/comments/b5iooh/has_anyone_used_the_region_of_waterloo_affordable/), they mean they want to have 5% stake in your house. It can be a good thing (if you're poor and just want a place to live) or a bad thing (if you're rich and want to be richer), so this is a very good system.
- VRTUCAR is owned by [Communauto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communauto), a private company headquartered in Montreal. [It is not a co-op](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/vrtucar-communauto-community-careshare-kw-waterloo-hamilton-1.4594729).

- The [spousal support advisory guideline](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/spousal-epoux/ssag-ldfpae.html) is just that: a guideline.

[The duration of it](https://nussbaumlaw.ca/how-long-does-spousal-support-last-in-ontario/) is also basically made-up, but you can think of it as "until you die" if the (number of years of marriage + age of recipient) add up to 65 or more.

- On why selling sex is legal but buying sex is not: so the marginalised (the prostitutes) don't risk going to jail by making a living. "Basically, more people are willing to buy sex legally than are willing to sell it. A LOT more. So when prostitution is legalized the demand shoots way up but the supply does not. This makes sex trafficking and forced prostitution very profitable. If you look at crime stats for human trafficking before and after prostitution is legalized, human trafficking actually goes up by a lot in countries where prostitution has been legalized. Legalizing selling sex while keeping it illegal to buy solves both problems. It doesn't increase demand, and it makes prostitution safer for everyone involved." - /u/The_Last_Mammoth
