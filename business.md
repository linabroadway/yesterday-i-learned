- [Hotelling's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law) says that it is reasonable for competitors to offer the same products and services with minimal differences (the opposite of product differentiation). For example, if a Home Depot is right next to a Lowes, then [no one will go to one or the other based on distance alone](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/rbseh9/eli5_why_are_gas_stations_also_close_by_one/hnpy2o0/), but rather the quality of the goods themselves.
- The [Friedman doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine) says that a company's sole responsibility is to its shareholders, and no one else; maximise returns to shareholders.
- Big companies give employees actual goals. You need to meet those goals to be promoted.

- Acquisition is one of the things most CEOs delay until it is too late.
- Your options (if any) are worth nothing until exercised, making them tax-free. Once they are exercised and turned into stocks, those stocks are also tax free until you sell them.
- Your options cannot be sold back to the company. That is, unless someone else wants to buy your options, they are also worth nothing.
- Your options are immediately vested ('yours', or eqv.) at no cost if the company gets acquired.
- Vesting means you earned some options. It doesn't mean you exercised them. When you exercise them, you have the option to buy stocks, which, [if the price you pay is different from the stock's fair market value (which it always is, because that's why you earn preferantial options in the first place) you pay a tax on that](http://blog.modernadvisor.ca/employee-stock-options-maximize-financial-gain/).
- [The four stages of company development](http://takeaswig.com/the-end-of-the-facebook-era): Emergence (when it started), Coalescence (when it becomes large enough that people can't ignore it), Bureaucratization (when it becomes a formal giant), and Decline (when it stops being useful)

- Do remember that [technical debt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10925141) _is_ debt; the time you borrow to make a feature must be paid back _soon_, and not _eventually_.
- The less money a startup has left, [the less likely it will receive more](http://paulgraham.com/pinch.html).
- Know what you are saving for. You can be saving for a house. You can be saving for a car. You can be saving for retirement. [Know your net worth, identify your goal, and work backwards.](https://www.businessinsider.com/first-step-early-retirement-planning-take-inventory)
- After a layoff, you should withdraw money from RRSP [only after you finish using your severance payments and EI](https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/retirement/rrsps-are-about-much-more-than-just-retirement), and when you have no income at all, where you are in the bottom tax bracket.
- In an economy where people run the risk of defaulting (which is not a "credit crunch", that's a different thing entirely), [companies that issue credit cards](https://www.mastercard.ca/en-ca/search-by-bank.html), like Scotiabank and Canadian Tire, do not do well.
- [The stock market is not a gauge for how well the economy is doing](https://theweek.com/articles/886198/booming-stock-market-shows-america-diseased); it is just an indicator for how well *companies* are doing, and, therefore, how quickly money is being funnelled---from [the government, ironically socialised](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/ej4qov/the_booming_stock_market_shows_america_is_diseased/fcvhph0/)---to the rich.
- Furloughs are forced unpaid leaves, sometimes regular (like during periods of time when no business is expected). The position remains guaranteed for the employee to return to.
- A Convertible note is a loan (debt), not some grant. At the end of a [convertible note's maturity date](https://www.indinero.com/blog/safe-convertible-notes-comparison), the founder must either pay back the loan plus interest, or convert the note into equity.

- There's a guide to [how much stock you give your employees at what size of the company](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/sections/typical-employee-equity-levels).
- "Common shares" are basically useless when "preferred shares" exist. Preferred shares are always sold first. If [the company ends up with $0 after the sale of those shares](https://marker.medium.com/my-company-sold-for-100-million-and-i-got-zilch-how-can-that-be-f7be0563f1f8), you, a proud owner of a billion common shares, end up with nothing as well.
- Watch out for ["cliffs" in equity vesting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27765421). A one-year cliff is where you get nothing for one year, but [you do get one year's worth of stocks after that one year](https://carta.com/blog/what-is-stock-vesting/), so it creates an incentive to stay at the company.
- You can *buy and sell* during a company's trading windows.

## [Management](https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/21-management-things-i-learned-at-imgur-7abb72bdf8bf)

- Don't attempt to manage unmotivated people.
- Give feedback frequently and directly.
- Fire quickly.
- With that said, if you manage a company that has bad "culture", [firing people has even more negative consequences on the culture](https://hbr.org/2018/11/case-study-can-you-fix-a-toxic-culture-without-firing-people).
- Listen when people explain the reasoning behind their decisions.
- Define success clearly, so people can meet it.
- "Sometimes people talk shit. Sometimes people have bad days. Don't take either personally."
- Your coworkers may want to discuss salary. [There are pros and cons](https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/Pros-And-Cons-Of-Discussing-Salaries-At-Work) to discussing salary. Most importantly, discussing salaries is to _your personal advantage_, but may be a disadvantage to team productivity.
- Product managers can be hired straight out of college. They do not require managerial experience (though it is good to have some, obviously).
- Amazon has [14 principles that help leaders be leaders](https://customerthink.com/the-14-leadership-principles-that-drive-amazon/).
- "When I became a manager in the tech field, I was going to do everything different. Managers suck and don't know what they're talking about. (...) I was going to be transparent. I was going to tell people everything. (...) It took about a year to realize that managers do the things they do for a reason. (...) Why is being transparent bad? Because upper levels of management are unstable. One day we're getting re-orged. One day we're doubling our staff. My job was to be the shit umbrella, not tell everyone every possible thing that might happen. (...) Why didn't my previous manager know about all the technical shit that I did? Because I was an SDE and he was a manager. They're not the same job. I tried to stay super connected to the tech until one of my reports told me, "I got 8 people on this team that can code. I got 1 person on this team who can be a manager. I need you to be the manager"" - [/u/Lotan](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/utd7s5/what_is_your_you_have_become_the_very_thing_you/i99wiy5/)

## [How not to fail](http://themacro.com/articles/2016/06/how-not-to-fail/)

- Make something people want. (be open to changing direction)
- Stay focused. (including networking)
- Measure your growth. (pick 'revenue' as a metric and focus on that)
- Know if you're default alive. (default alive is operational breakeven)
- Keep expenses low. (don't hire too many people)
- Fundraising gets harder. (VCs don't fund failures)

## Agile / Lean / Scrum

- [Value-stream mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping) forces you to list out the processes, mention what value each step brings, and eliminate processes that don't bring any value.
