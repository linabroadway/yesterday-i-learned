## Not actually linguistics

> the scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of morphology, syntax, phonetics, and semantics

- In the Spanish name [*Jorge*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge), the J and G sound exactly the same (`x`, like an H). The original Gs in *Georgios* (Γεώργιος) in Greek sound like a Y.
- *Le monde* is one of the examples in French where [a word ending with *e* is masculine](https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/french-easy-learning/gender). Other examples: *homme*, *livre* (if used to mean "book"), *mètre*.
- "JWT" is pronounced "jot" due to shear difficulty in pronouncing it correctly.
- [Upsetti Spaghetti](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Upsetti%20Spaghetti): a way to say "upset", but with more syllables.
- Shea butter is shay butter?
- Classical Latin goes from [100 BC to 200 AD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7uBUCZgpw8), and it's the *good shit* if you want to imitate someone who lived during that time. In classical Latin, vowel lengths are critical to understanding what a word means.
- *Flouting* [Grice's maxims in the cooperative principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle) would be intentionally violating one of the maxims of (quantity, quality, relation, manner) (i.e. depth, truth, relevance, and clarity) in order to convey a different meaning than what was said. For example, by saying [vegan tomatoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJEaMtNN_dM), you violate the maxim of quantity, and used it to imply that other tomatoes aren't vegan. Or, if you say "my student regularly attends tutorials", you violate the maxim of relation, trying to hint at the student's poor lecture attendance record.
- A rude sound made by sticking out the tongue and blowing is also called a [raspberry](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/raspberry). See [also](http://www.flatlandcomics.ca/dailies/BlindOptimism.htm)
- The french "LL" is pronounced "Y" only if it is preceded by an I.
- Agency is the power to do something.
- "Suffering" came from [Latin, *sufferō*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suffer) (*sub-* + *fero*, "under-carry"). "Suffrage" came from [Latin, *suffragium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage#Etymology), which literally means a ballot, but the word root ultimately traces to [some nonsense about the knuckle bone](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suffrago#Latin).
- Americans put the ending punctuation of a quote, "inside a quote," which [makes no sense](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/the-american-style-of-quotation-mark-punctuation-makes-no-sense/). Brits put the same thing, "outside the quote".
- "Replace" and "remove" could have meant the same thing at some point in time.
- You are accountable *for* something, but accountable *to* someone.
- *Samoa* is more SA-muah than it is sa-MO-ah.
- *Entrepreneur* ("undertaker") means someone who takes on work, i.e. someone who does stuff without someone else telling them what to do.
- "Soupy" can mean "lots of clouds".
- "Thy" and "Thine" used to be [analogues](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/406491) of "your" and "yours". But sometimes it gets confusing because "thine" is used if the word after "thy" begins with a vowel sound, like "thine eyes".
- *Wasabi* is phonetically derived from the Chinese words 委佐俾. But they write it as 山葵, which does not sound at all like wasabi. This is because Japanese have a system called 平假名 (hiragana), which... means you read one thing but say another? I am not sure.
- Just like other words that begin with a P, the P in *psychologie* is pronounced [as if there is no special rule for it](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/pronunciation/p/).
- "MacDonald" means [Donald's son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_name). If the child is a daughter, then the last name becomes *Nic Donald* or similar. *O'Donald* is the male version of "descendant of Donald"; if you are female in some way, you end up using *Ní Donald* probably.
- "Milquetoast" means timid. People have come to understand it as "milk toast".
- What a husband does is [husbandry](https://www.google.com/search?q=husbandry): the care, cultivation, and breeding of crops and animals. The word [husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husband) meant "homeowner" (*hūs-* + *būandi*).
- [Baobab](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/baobab#Pronunciation) is pronounced "bay-oh-bab", but only in English. In other languages, you just say "bao".
- "Dilettante": a person who has an interest, but not commitment or knowledge in something. Like me, collecting useless facts.
- There are [three phrases for "I" in Japanese](https://www.quora.com/What-does-watashi-wa-mean-in-Japanese): Watashi (most formal), boKu (general use by men), Ore (informal). "When you get used to Japanese to some degree, be careful with the accent. If you stress Bo, it sounds childish. Always put an accent on Ku."
- The Japanese word for "gallery" is just ギャラリー, or *Gyarari*. It's fascinating how they manage.
- In contemporary usage, "They" is used to describe something with [unspecified gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenity), while ["It"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_%28pronoun%29) seems to be reserved for objects that have no gender, other than children and pets, for some reason.
- Apparently "sceptic" is the UK spelling of the word "skeptic". The C version came from Latin *scepticus*, which came from the Greek K version, *skeptikós*.

- [Dietitians prefer to be spelled dietitians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian#The_spellings_%22dietitian%22_and_%22dietician%22), but the word was originally dietician so they basically prefer to be wrong (if new is wrong).
- The [etymological fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy): the incorrect assumption that a word always means roughly the same thing as its word root. "Grandfathering" is not a sexist term, even though it was "grandfather" in it.
- A bugbear is an annoyance. Somehow you saw that word twice in one week.
- "**Whom** should I give this job to" is [always wrong](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/226282/is-whom-should-i-give-this-job-to-grammatically-correct), because you would have gone with "**To whom** should I give this job" if you are trying be use who/whom correctly, or "Who should I give this job to" if you plan to speak informally.
- ["The first element in an array"](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/361761/116811) can refer to either `array[0]` (as in the item that is the first in the array)
- In UK English, "Composite" is *always* pronounced with the stress on the C. In US English, "comPosite" is *always* pronounced with the stress on the P.

- Indians invented the word ["updation"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/updation), which could have just been "update", but just like they invented "very less", they traded a simple word for a more complicated one.
- Today's youth hath invented a phrase ["cash-money"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cash-Money), to be used wherever "cool" or "awesome" serves as an adjective.
- The French word *Champignon* comes from Latin *campāniolus*, "grows in the fields". Grass is also a mushroom.
- Since there is no such thing as "informally" charging someone of a crime, to indict someone (formally charging someone) is the exact same as just charging someone.
- That "say when" thing waitors do is [informal](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/71939/how-did-when-become-the-customary-answer-to-say-when). Your reply is not necessarily "when", either. Saying OK works just as well.
- "[Häagen Dazs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen-Dazs#Origin_of_brand_name)" doesn't mean anything. The company was founded in 1960 by [a couple of Polish-origin Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_and_Rose_Mattus) in Bronx.
- In Punjabi, a lakh is called lakkh.
- "Less" has been used with countable nouns before year 1770, at which point a Robert Baker [remarked](https://www.arrantpedantry.com/2008/12/23/less-and-fewer/) that "fewer" sounded better with countable nouns so should be used in "less"'s place... but [he never said others needed to share the same preference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/fewer-vs-less). Units of time remains an exception to the [fewer vs less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fewer_versus_less) rule, and since the US was founded in 1776, it may be forgivable for not following this rule at all.
- The [nominative & accusative cases](https://learn-german-easily.com/german-case-accusative) can be thought of as "nominative eats the accusative", or "the main character beats up the secondary character". In the case of German, if a noun is used in the accusative case, and it is "masculine", then the *ein* becomes *einen*. See also: [how messed up it is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_articles).
- A knucklehead is an idiot.
- In "all but forgotten", "all but" means "nearly", literally the opposite meaning of the original phrase. In phrases like "post-COVID consumer spending has all but recovered", just pretend they said nothing. Soon, "literally" will literally mean the opposite of "literally", too.
- 阿媽都唔認得 means [阿媽認唔到你](https://lihkg.com/thread/1017464/page/1), not 你認唔到阿媽.
- You can [almost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_%28name%29) tell where a Muhammad came from by looking at the spelling. Muhammad is the Arabic one, Mohamed is the Egyptian one, Mohammad is the Persian one, and Muhammed is the Turkish one. Exceptions obviously apply.
- "Preposterous" (pre-posterous) is absurd. "Posterous" (post-erous) isn't anything. "Erous" isn't anything, either. So a "pre-post erous" isn't exactly defined.
- *Cortez*, from Old French *corteis / curteis, means courteous or polite.
- Capital punishment is called that because "Capital" means "of the head".
- Y in Spanish can sound like *Y-*, *J-*, or *Sh-*, [depending on the accent](https://www.spanishdict.com/answers/112730/yo...when-is-it-pronounced-yo-and-when-is-it-joe). Alternatively, you can say that the Spanish [LL sounds like both of these](https://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/learn/spanish/spanish-tips/spanish-ll-pronunciation). "In Spanish, J and Y are allophones (note: I don't think this term was used correctly), meaning that they can be substituted for each other."
- In Quebec, *poutine* (normally poo-TEEN) becomes POO-tin.

These were [words used in 1912](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/432382).
- Zero of something is singular in French. For Russian, because they must ensure crippling alcoholism is carried on by the generations to come, [the rules are based purely on the number's ending digit](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/12186), and [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_%28grammatical_number%29) (2 ~ 4) and plural (5 ~ 9, 0) are different concepts... except 11 (supposedly singular), 12 (supposedly dual), 13 (supposedly dual), and 14 (supposedly dual), which are plurals.

That became "damsel" in the Yuan dynasty. "小姐" may still be used to contextually refer to prostitutes, so you may be forced to use ["女士"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E4%BA%BA) (educated woman) or ["姑娘"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A7%91%E5%A8%98) (young woman, servant, or a prostitute in a brothel who has yet to receive a customer) instead. There is also "夫人" for when you want to refer to a woman as someone's wife.
- ["先生"](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F/4066) didn't explicitly refer to men either.
